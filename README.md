# FAA Enforcement Monitoring System

## Overview
The **FAA Enforcement Monitoring System** is a data engineering and analytics project designed to process and analyze **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enforcement action records**.  
The **current goal** is to build a robust **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline** for data ingestion, cleaning, and publishing.  
The **stretch goal** is to implement a **real-time monitoring dashboard** with predictive analytics to identify potential safety and compliance risks.  

## Data Source
The datasets used in this project are sourced from the **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Enforcement Information System**.
You can access the raw enforcement data here:  
ðŸ”— [FAA Enforcement Actions Reports](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/enforcement/reports)

## Features

### âœ… Current Capabilities
- **Automated ELT Pipeline**  
  - Extracts raw FAA enforcement reports from multiple formats (PDF, XLSX, CSV).  
  - Cleans, standardizes, and merges data into a unified schema.  
  - Outputs **publish-ready datasets** in CSV/XLSX for downstream use.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Performed in Jupyter Notebooks (`analysis for cleaning.ipynb`, `faa_enforcement_analysis.ipynb`).  
  - Trend analysis by year, violation type, and enforcement action.  
  - Data quality validation and governance compliance.  

- **Data Publishing**  
  - Final cleaned datasets (`faa_enforcement_final_cleaned.csv`) are documented and stored for reproducibility.  
  - Supports integration with BI tools (Power BI, Tableau).

### ðŸš€ Planned Enhancements (Stretch Goals)  
- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  - Build with Power BI / Tableau / Plotly Dash for dynamic filtering and visualization.  

- **Predictive Analytics**  
  - Implement ML models to forecast potential safety/compliance risks.  

- **Automated Cloud Deployment**  
  - Host ETL on AWS with scheduled refresh and CI/CD integration.
